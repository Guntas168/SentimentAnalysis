# SentimentAnalysis
It’s estimated that 80% of the world’s data is unstructured and not organized in a pre-defined manner. Most of this comes from text data, like emails, support tickets, chats, social media, surveys, articles, and documents. These texts are usually difficult, time-consuming and expensive to analyze, understand, and sort through. With the help of sentiment analysis systems, this unstructured information could be automatically transformed into structured data of public opinions about products, services, brands, politics, or any topic that people can express opinions about. This data can be very useful for commercial applications like marketing analysis, public relations, product reviews, net promoter scoring, product feedback, and customer service.
